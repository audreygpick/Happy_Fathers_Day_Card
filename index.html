                <p>HAPPY FATHERS DAY!! Thank you for being my dad! Thank you for putting up with me and setting me straight when I need it.
                Thank you for washing my car last weekend, initiating a regrip on my racket, cutting plastic for my picture frame,
                supplying the peppers I needed for my food this last week, explaining your compressor, and supplying me with a dolly&
                straps& moving advice. I love you. You are the wisest and most caring - in the ways that matter most - person I know. I
                genuinely want to think, listen, and question more like you. I would like to be adventurous in my 20s like you were,
                continue to travel like you have, and bring value to work and my community like you continue to do. I would also like to
                plan more, but that is least priority.</p>
                <p class="name">
                    love,
                    <br >
